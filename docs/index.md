# Privacy Policy for BunSense

**Effective date:** 2026-02-08

BunSense (“the Extension”) helps users read Japanese by providing furigana, translation, and grammar assistance. This policy explains what data the Extension handles and how it is used.

## Data We Handle
The Extension may process the following data to provide its features:

- **Selected text and page content**: When you use translation, furigana, or grammar features, the selected text (and sometimes surrounding text for context) is processed to generate results.
- **Extension settings**: Preferences such as furigana color/size, target language, and UI options are stored using Chrome’s storage APIs (sync and local).
- **Notebook entries**: If you save vocabulary or grammar notes, these are stored in Chrome sync storage.
- **API keys (optional)**: If you enable AI features and enter an OpenAI or DeepSeek API key, it is stored **locally on your device** using Chrome local storage (not synced).

## How We Use Data
We use the data only to provide the Extension’s features:
- Generate translations, furigana, and grammar explanations
- Store your settings and saved notes
- Call external services that you request (see below)

## External Services
Depending on the feature you use, the Extension may send text to third‑party services, including:
- **OpenAI** or **DeepSeek** (AI explanations/translation when enabled)
- **Jisho.org** (dictionary lookups)
- **Google Translate public API endpoint** (default translation)

These services receive the text you choose to process. Their handling of data is governed by their own privacy policies.

## Data Sharing
We do **not** sell or share your personal data with advertisers or other third parties. Data is only sent to external services when you actively use those features.

## Data Retention and Deletion
- Settings and notebook entries remain in your Chrome storage until you clear extension data or uninstall the Extension.
- AI API keys are stored locally and can be removed from the Extension’s settings.

## Security
We take reasonable steps to minimize data collection and only process data needed to provide the features. However, no method of transmission over the Internet is 100% secure.

## Children’s Privacy
The Extension is not intended for children under 13 and does not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## Changes to This Policy
We may update this policy from time to time. The effective date will be updated when changes are made.
